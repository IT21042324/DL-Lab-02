1. Upload the Backprop.ipynb to Jupyter notebook (or google colab) and see if you can understand
the code. Increase the number of iterations (epochs) and see whether it improves the prediction
accuracy.

    Error seems to have reduced even further compared to 200 number of iterations. 
    Seems like with the given learning rate of 0.5 can do better with a larger number of 
    iterations when attmepting to calculate the minimum cost to find the best weights



2.Upload the NN_sample.ipynb to Jupyter notebook (or google colab) and see if you can
understand the code. Add the following text cell and the code cell to the notebook and run it
again.

    2.1. What happens when the number of hidden nodes increase?

    When the number of hidden nodes were set to a lower number the accuracy was low (in the 60s). 
    This could mean the model might not be complex enough to capture the relevant information potentially leading
    to a case of underfitting. However when the number of hiddne layers increase we see a substantial amount
    of growth in the prediction accuracy while the error kept reducing. 
    This could mean the model is capturing the necessary relevant infor from the input data and the model complexity 
    is high. However when the hidden nodes increased past a certain amount (>20) the accuracy of the model seems
    to fluctuate in between 90 - 93% implying that the best cost has been achived within this range. However we do
    not know if the model is overly complex which could lead it to overfitting. 
    Meaning the model has to be tested with a test data and the correct number of hidden nodes has to be 
    decided upon it

    2.2. Can you explain the pattern of the accuracy when the hidden nodes increase?

    (PLOT IS SHOWN IN THE NN_sample.ipynb file) Initially from 2-4 hidden layers, the accuracy would substantially increase
    from 67% to 90%. Afterwards it reaches the minimum cost and any substantial increase in hidden layers(4-10, 10-20, 20-50, 50-70 hidden layers)
    would not bring any significant change as accuracies would fluctuate between 90% to 94%.
